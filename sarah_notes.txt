a lot of email list exchanges

get email lists from other companies by offering a discount code for the class or workshop

gave away frontline

sometimes other companies ask for an exchange and ask for their stuff in front of our students

coffee shop, first 100 users we buy their coffee, just give us their emails

each email costs $2.50
calculated from cost of events, partnership, or sponsoring an event
  sponsor will get email lists of big events


events in your space are the best converting


college entrepreneur clubs
  high interest and attendance, but conversion is long tail
  they probably convert after a year or two

email list attrition


when we get a partner email list, send them a welcome to GA email to subscribe
  subscribers are the conversion rate


businesses targeted:
  tech, meetups, young women in digital
  trade schools
  Brooklyn Boulders
  coffee shops
  do more work with gyms (more expensive gyms) (equinox/fitcorp)
  young people in non-profits association
  any special interest group


  customize email introduction
  bostinno

30 enrollments per 3000 emails over the course of a year

lead time is at least 6 weeks, sometimes 1 week lead time LOL

signups within 10 days of start or before 3 months out usually drop


probably should use mailchimp


try tabling at an event or school??


best way to get enrollment is word of mouth

front end is more appealing to people
  more appeal to digital marketers (email mockups)
  ux designer ( front end stuff )

if you're going to learn back end it's because you want to become a coder


target hackathons as events??

don't want to pay for sponsorship just for the logo, need email list or some form of contact

1/4 of students had company sponsorship
  tripadvisor had a great conversion
  company sometimes covers 1k, other times full tuition, depends on perks
  would ask that the project be work related
  may need to soft sell the manager on directed projects
  sometimes would ask for a writeup of the student's performance
  if student cant afford, you can ask them about company sponsorship
