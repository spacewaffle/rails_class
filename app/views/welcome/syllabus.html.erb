  <div class="rundown">
    <p>The 10 week RailsClass program is focused on giving beginners a deep dive into building full-fledged web applications. We'll start off by setting up your computer with all the tools you'll need to be an effective developer. Git, Ruby on Rails, Sublime Text, and the Command Line. Once that's done, we'll spend the next few weeks exploring fundamental programming concepts using the Ruby programming language. 
    </p>
    <p>
    After you've gotten the hang of Ruby, it's time to take the skills you've learned and build some web sites! We'll show you the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails, a powerful framework that uses Ruby to create dynamic web applications. Now these aren't your run of the mill info sites. With Ruby on Rails, you'll be able to build social networks, ecommerce platforms, customizable blogs, and more. We'll finish off the class with a final project you get to choose that will serve as a portfolio piece once.</p>
