    <p>Jon was a great teacher for Ruby on Rails. He taught the concepts behind the code so you could truly understand how it works. Jon would help guide you to the 'aha' moment instead of directly giving you the answer to what you're currently stuck on. That was an important part of learning for me.</p>

    <p>I took a back end web development course with Jon, and he's just what you'd want in an instructor - knowledgable, patient, teaches by example. I went from no foundation in Rails at all to being able to build pretty complex apps in not much more than a few weeks.</p>

    <p>It takes more than a good coder to teach rails. Jon is a good coder and a good teacher. He has a deep knowledge of ruby and rails, fielded questions easily and quickly whether they came up inside of class or out, and used clear examples to simplify tough topics. He took a group of students with a range of CS experience and made the class accessible to beginners like me and interesting to full-time developers. Thanks to Jon, learning rails was fun and interesting, and never (too) scary. </p>
