    <strong>Lily Kaiser</strong>
    <p>It takes more than a good coder to teach rails. Jon is a good coder and a good teacher. <!-- He has a deep knowledge of ruby and rails, fielded questions easily and quickly whether they came up inside of class or out, and used clear examples to simplify tough topics.  -->He took a group of students with a range of CS experience and made the class accessible to beginners like me and interesting to full-time developers. Thanks to Jon, learning rails was fun and interesting, and never (too) scary. </p>

    <strong>Eric Benoit</strong>
    <p>Jon was a great teacher for Ruby on Rails. He taught the concepts behind the code so you could truly understand how it works. Jon would help guide you to the 'aha' moment instead of directly giving you the answer to what you're currently stuck on. That was an important part of learning for me.</p>

    <strong>Shayna Cummins</strong>
    <p>I came into the course as a complete novice and was immediately hooked on Ruby. Jon is an excellent instructor: smart, friendly, and very patient. He's extremely well-spoken and able to easily break down challenging concepts into terms anyone can understand. He is totally plugged into the Ruby community and has worked on some very cool projects across the stack. I learned a ton from Jon and would highly recommend him to anyone!</p>

      <p>Jon clearly understands development and has an ability to pass that understanding on to students. He helped in class while students had questions and also made himself readily available after-hours to anyone who needed more assistance. A strong developer himself, Jon helped us flesh out our own [projects] and bring them to life. His development skills and ability to simply explain code make him a strong instructor.</p>

      <strong>Evan B</strong>
      <p>I took a back end web development course with Jon, and he's just what you'd want in an instructor - knowledgable, patient, teaches by example. I went from no foundation in Rails at all to being able to build pretty complex apps in not much more than a few weeks.</p>

  <h2>Why RailsClass?</h2>
  <p class="text centered">While RailsClass was born from instructors at General Assembly's Back End Web Development program, we're not one of the big guys. The good news is we're a smaller outfit with less overhead. This means we can offer smaller class sizes, a more competitive price, and ultimately better value.</p>
